Reverse Number is a number which is the same when reversed.

For Example;
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101 => First 20 Reverse Numbers
  

TASK:

    You need to return the nth reverse number. (Assume that reverse numbers start from 0 as shown in the example.)

NOTES:

    1 < n <= 100000000000
    You need to use BigInt as return type in JS since it exceeds max integer size.

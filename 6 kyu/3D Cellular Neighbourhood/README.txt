Description:

This kata is the third part of a series: Neighbourhood kata collection. You may want to do the first two before trying this version.
Now we are ready for higher dimensions

We add one dimension. You should have good spatial thinking to solve this kata.

There are two popular types of cellular neighbourhoods:

    Moore neighborhood - cells that shape a 'square' around the given cell
    Von Neumann neighborhood - cells that shape a 'diamond' around the given cell

Task

Given a neighbourhood type ("moore" or "von_neumann"), a MxNxK 3D matrix (list of lists of lists), a 3-tuple of coordinates and the distance, return the list of neighbours of the given cell.

Order of the indices: The first index should be applied for the outer/first matrix layer. The last index for the most inner/last layer. coordinates = (i, j, k) should be applied like mat[i][j][k]

Note: you should return an empty array if any of these conditions are true:

    Matrix is empty
    Coordinates are outside the matrix
    Distance is equal to 0

Example:

I have tried my best to represent a 3D matrix.

It would be very difficult to represent distances higher than 1 in the example. But you already know what to do with the distance from the previous kata.

(i==0) k 0    1    2   
    j  ----------------  (i==1)               
    0  | 0  | 1  | 2  | ---------------- (i==2)
    1  | 3  | 4  | 5  | | 9  | 10 | 11 | ----------------
    2  | 6  | 7  | 8  | | 12 | 13 | 14 | | 18 | 19 | 20 | 
       ---------------- | 15 | 16 | 17 | | 21 | 22 | 23 | 
                        ---------------- | 24 | 25 | 26 | 
                                         ----------------
